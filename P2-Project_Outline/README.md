# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The pre-COVID number is 18,000-plus. That’s how many animals came through the Animal Care and Control Team of Philadelphia’s 
doors in 2019. The young and the old. The injured and the sick. The tame and the wild. The well-behaved … and not so 
well-behaved. Even dangerous animals. The shelter turns none away. ACCT Philly is the only open-admission shelter, contracted by 
the City to take in stray and abandoned animals and owner-surrendered pets. In 2019, the live release rate was 
roughly 75 percent. ACCT Philly provides spay/neuter and vaccination services to many of our adoptable cats and dogs in the 
shelter and to more than 3,700 community cats through the TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return) program. 
 
ACCT Philly is dedicated to working with their partners and the community to save as many healthy and treatable animals as resources and 
capacity for care will permit. They are the first stop on the road to second chances. Who wouldn't want to see an increase in the live release rate for Philly’s homeless 
animals? The shelter is woefully understaffed and underfunded.  The shelter could not run without volunteers. As a volunteer I can tell you we need help!  Right now, "there's not an app for that." 
### Features
Some asks:  The app should drive the collection of data, e.g., animal behavior, animal health (do they need to see a vet?), volunteer provided animal training (teaching to walk on leash/take treats gently), bathroom habits (did they pee/poop on their walk), treats given (how many, what kind, favorites?), whether or not food in kennel has been eaten, animal socialization (Do they like other dogs? Are they candidate for play group?), etc. This information will benefit the health and safety of the volunteers as well as increase the chance for a good outcome for the animal.  Volunteers that know in advance if an animal is fearful or agitated will know to keep an eye on the "bitey end" of the animal.  Animals that bite, even if accidentally, are usually put down so avoiding this at all costs is paramount.  Animals that are noted as being well behaved and healthy have a better chance of being pulled by a no-kill rescue or adopted outright from the shelter.  Should be mobile, QR Code reader, authenticator, links to information.
